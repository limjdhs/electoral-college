# begin 0
We start by defining (def) a function called click_state that takes the input of a state. A function is a section of our program that will perform a specific task - in this case, what happens whenever we click on a state.
# end 0
# begin 1 
    When we click on a state, we want the state's color to change. We'll make the variable new_color that will be a change from the current color.
# end 1
# begin 2
    We're then going to start a conditional, which is a tool in programming that's like a decision tree. In this case, we're checking to see if the new_color is blue.
# end 2
# begin 3
        If the new_color is blue, we're going to set the variable for the Republican vote (rep_vote) to less than half (0.49, or 49%). We're also going to change the slider value (to 49 out of 100).
# end 3
# begin 4
    Then comes the next step of the conditional. If the new_color was not blue but it is red, we'll do the next step.
# end 4
# begin 5
        If the new color is red, we're going to set the variable for the Republican vote (rep_vote) to greater than half (0.51, or 51%). We're also going to change the slider value (to 51 out of 100). 
# end 5
# begin 6
    This is the last step of the conditional, for if new_color was not blue or red.
# end 6
# begin 7
        If the new color is not blue or red, it must be gray for neutral. We're going to set the variable for the Republican vote (rep_vote) to exactly half (0.50, or 50%). We're also going to change the slider value (to 50 out of 100). 
# end 7
# begin 8
    Now that the vote has changed, we want the variable of current_color to change to the value of the new color. 
# end 8
# begin 9
    So we've changed the variable for the Republican vote, but we have not actually changed the electoral or popular bars. The next step will be run two functions that will update these bars.
# end 9
